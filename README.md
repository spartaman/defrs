# DefRS
A collection of useful general resources made ready to be used with the Defold game engine

The purpose of this shader collection is for each to be generally useful, efficient, and to work on Open GL ES 2.0. If you've made a shader which you think would be useful to others please consider contributing it via a pull request. If you can improve an existing shader to add useful features or increase performance please submit your changes!

## Installation
You can use DefRS in your own project by adding this project as a [Defold library dependency](http://www.defold.com/manuals/libraries/). Open your game.project file and in the dependencies field under project add:

	https://github.com/subsoap/defrs/archive/master.zip

Once installed, you can use the resources you wish to use from their associated folders much like you would builtin materials. When you make builds Defold will only package the files you actually use so do not worry about the extra files included. Check your build folder to see for yourself.

Check the source files and examples for full usage.
